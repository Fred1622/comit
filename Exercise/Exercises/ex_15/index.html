                    <p> Pokemon Sword and Shield has been dogged by <strong>controversy</strong> ever since it was revealed not every Pokemon from past generations will be coming to the Nintendo Switch. Also known as the National Pokedex, the removal of the popular feature has turned off a lot of longtime Pokemon fans, to the point where not even the recently revealed puppy Pokemon, Yamper, is immune to online haters.To be fair, it’s not so much Yamper itself that is receiving criticism, but Yamper’s animation work. </p>

            <p> We hope that Game Freak and Nintendo will finaly listen to what the fans really want, and would make a worthy 8th gen pokemon game. </p>
